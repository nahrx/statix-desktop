When creating static tables for data dissemination on the BPS website, statistical tables must be prepared in both Excel and HTML formats. These files are then uploaded through the static table creation form on the BPS website. Typically, the tables are first created in Excel and then converted into HTML.

Currently, the process of converting Excel tables to HTML is carried out manually, one by one, using Microsoft Excel. In addition, the generated HTML files still require structural adjustments to match the format standards expected by the BPS website. This manual process is inefficient and time-consuming.

To streamline the creation of static tables, a dedicated application is needed to convert Excel tables into HTML that fully complies with the BPS websiteâ€™s formatting requirements. This application, called StatiX, enables bulk conversion of Excel tables to HTML in a single operation. The resulting HTML files are immediately ready for use, eliminating the need for further manual adjustments.
